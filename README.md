# Cache-Efficiency-Analysis-and-Profile-based-GPU-Cache-Bypassing

1. Developed a profile-based cache bypassing mode for cache-unfriendly benchmarks, leveraging access counts obtained from profiler mode to
bypass cache accesses to specific addresses.
2. When executed in profile-based bypass mode within GPGPUsim, cache-unfriendly benchmarks exhibited the anticipated increase in IPC
